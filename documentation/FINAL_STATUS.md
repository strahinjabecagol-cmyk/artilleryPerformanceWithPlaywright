## 🐛 Bug Fixed

### **Issue Found:**
- **Error:** `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'counters' before initialization`
- **Location:** Line 578 in `loadData()` function
- **Cause:** Variable `counters` was being used in test metadata section before it was declared

### **Solution:**
- Moved `counters` and `summaries` declaration to the beginning of the function
- Now declared at line 551 (BEFORE test metadata section)
- Test metadata section now works correctly at line 578

### **Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
document.getElementById('scenarioCount').textContent = Object.keys(counters)... // Line 578
const counters = data.aggregate?.counters || {}; // Line 581 - TOO LATE!

// AFTER (fixed):
const counters = data.aggregate?.counters || {}; // Line 551 - FIRST!
const summaries = data.aggregate?.summaries || {}; // Line 552
// ... then use them in metadata section at line 578 ✅
```

## 🎯 Test Results Summary

**From the working dashboard:**

### Performance Overview
- **Test Duration:** 51 seconds
- **Virtual Users:** 240 total (100% completion)
- **HTTP Requests:** 3,891 total
- **Success Rate:** 100% ✅
- **Apdex Score:** 0.625 (Poor) ⚠️

### Core Web Vitals Performance
All metrics rated **GOOD**:
- FCP at 1686ms is well within the "good" threshold (<1800ms)
- LCP matches FCP at 1686ms (good <2500ms)
- FID is excellent at 1.1ms (good <100ms)
- CLS is perfect at 0.000 (good <0.1)

### Why Apdex is Poor Despite Good Metrics?
The Apdex calculation uses a stricter threshold (1500ms) than Core Web Vitals:
- **Apdex threshold:** 1500ms (satisfied)
- **FCP p50:** ~1686ms (tolerating)
- **Result:** More requests fall into "tolerating" range
- **Score:** 0.625 indicates room for optimization
