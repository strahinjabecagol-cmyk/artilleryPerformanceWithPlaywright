Filtering by phase issues

1 if i select all phases the apdex is 0.875 with curent data that i have.
    but each individual phase apdex is 1.0
    And also if i select 2 phases apdex is 1
    any other combination is 1 too.
    so only when all phases are selected apdex is 0.875

 2   There is an issue with latency distribution chart when less than all phases are selected.

    when i select all phases the chart is correct
    but when i select any other combination of phases
    the latency distribution chart is not correct.
   
3   There is also issue with HTTP Requests chart sometthing feels off in the numbers it shows multible bars on the chart with thousands of requests in the chart but it than doesnt do the math for me i think this should be explored deeper.   Actually this may be correct ther ei slike 27k reqyests sooo...
