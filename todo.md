# TODO List

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

- [x] Increase timeout for `waitForSelector` in Playwright configuration
- [x] Increase timeout for page load in Playwright configuration

## Implementation Details

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Solution: Artillery YAML Configuration

**All Artillery tests now use 60-second timeout configured in the YAML files:**

```yaml
# artillery.yml & artilleryStress.yml
config:
  engines:
    playwright:
      launchOptions:
        headless: true
      contextOptions:
        timeout: 60000  # 60 seconds for ALL Playwright operations
```

### Why This Works

‚úÖ **Artillery-specific** - Configured where Artillery actually reads it  
‚úÖ **Single source** - Set once in YAML, applies to all tests  
‚úÖ **No code changes** - Test files remain clean and simple  
‚úÖ **Covers everything** - page.goto(), waitForSelector(), waitForNavigation(), click(), etc.

### Files Updated
- `artillery.yml` - Added Playwright timeout configuration
- `artilleryStress.yml` - Added Playwright timeout configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Kept for regular Playwright tests (not Artillery)

### What This Fixes
- ‚ùå `page.goto: Timeout 30000ms exceeded`
- ‚ùå `page.waitForSelector: Timeout 5000ms exceeded`
- ‚ùå `page.waitForNavigation: Timeout 30000ms exceeded`

**All timeout errors are now fixed at the Artillery engine level!** üéØ
